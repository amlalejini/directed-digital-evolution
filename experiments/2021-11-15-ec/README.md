# 2021-11-15 - Evolutionary computing experiment

This experiment investigates the relative performance of the selection schemes used in our directed evolution model in an evolutionary computing context (for which most of them were designed).

From 2021-11-11-selection experiment, median approximate number of generations elapsed ~57,000. So, for this experiment, I'll run populations for 55,000 generations.
